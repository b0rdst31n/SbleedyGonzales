description: "In STMicroelectronics WB55 SDK V1.3.0 and earlier, a vulnerability allows a rogue central device to deadlock the peripheral by sending two consecutive ATT request packets per connection event. This disrupts the peripheral's ability to respond in time, leading to a coprocessor fault that prevents BLE event flags from being cleared, resulting in a deadlock. Without a stability mechanism like a watchdog timer, affected devices remain unresponsive and require a manual reset; with such a mechanism, the device will restart instead, leading to potential denial of service (DoS)."
