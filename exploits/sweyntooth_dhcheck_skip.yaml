description: "The DHCheck Skip vulnerability in Texas Instruments CC2640R2 BLE SoCs allows a partial security bypass during secure connection pairing. This flaw enables the DHCheck to be skipped by initiating the LL Encryption Procedure prematurely. Consequently, the Long-Term Key (LTK) generated before DHCheck completion is installed and used, allowing encryption setup without validating IO capabilities (IOCap) or completing the Key distribution process. Although this vulnerability compromises security compliance, it requires physical access or a compromised central BLE device, as it cannot be exploited over-the-air due to the necessity of possessing the session-specific private key. This vulnerability highlights a specification gap in the BLE Core guidelines regarding encryption setup timing."
