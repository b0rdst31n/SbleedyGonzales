description: "This script examines LE support and whether a device supports simultaneous LE and BR/EDR modes, which are prerequisites for Cross-Transport Key Derivation (CTKD) and therefore for the BLUR attack. A BLUR (Bluetooth Link-Layer Relay) attack exploits devices with both LE and BR/EDR capabilities to relay data between an attacker and a target, bypassing traditional pairing protections. So if a device supports simultaneous LE and BR/EDR and Bluetooth 4.2+, it will be marked as vulnerable. For further testing about BLUR please refer to https://github.com/francozappa/blur."
