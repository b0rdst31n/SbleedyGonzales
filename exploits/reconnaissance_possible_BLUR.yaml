description: "This script examines Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) support and whether a device supports simultaneous LE and BR/EDR (Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate) modes, which are prerequisites for a BLUR attack. A BLUR (Bluetooth Link-Layer Relay) attack exploits devices with both LE and BR/EDR capabilities to relay data between an attacker and a target, bypassing traditional pairing protections. If a device supports simultaneous LE and BR/EDR, it may be vulnerable to this type of relay attack, compromising the security of the connection."
