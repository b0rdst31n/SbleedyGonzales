description: "The Key Size Overflow vulnerability variation in Telink BLE SDKs affects devices with secure connection pairing enabled, allowing an attacker within radio range to bypass encryption by exploiting an out-of-order encryption request. This occurs when the Telink peripheral, due to lack of validation, accepts an encryption procedure without a valid Long-Term Key (LTK), defaulting the LTK to zero. As a result, the attacker can easily derive the session key (SK) and complete the encryption procedure, bypassing the key distribution phase. This vulnerability grants unauthorized access to all functionalities of the BLE device, compromising user privacy and control over protected applications. Ironically, devices limited to legacy pairing are less impacted by this flaw."
