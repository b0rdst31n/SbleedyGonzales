description: "This script tests for the NiNo (NoInputNoOutput) vulnerability in Bluetooth devices, where a device pairs without requiring user input, potentially allowing unauthorized connections. The script sets up the Bluetooth agent in NiNo mode, removes existing connections, scans for the target device, and, if found, pairs and attempts a connection. A successful connection indicates vulnerability, as the device permits unauthenticated access, which could expose data and enable unauthorized control by attackers within range. Finally, the script removes the device from saved connections to reset for subsequent checks."
