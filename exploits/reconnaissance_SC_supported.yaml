description: "This script inspects Bluetooth device features, focusing on Secure Connections (SC) support, based on data from a reconnaissance script. SC, introduced in Bluetooth 4.2, significantly strengthens pairing security by using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, which protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. If a device lacks SC support, it uses weaker encryption methods from earlier Bluetooth versions, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access by attackers within range. The absence of SC is a security vulnerability, as it exposes the device to exploitation due to outdated encryption protocols."
