description: "This script analyzes Bluetooth device capabilities, specifically checking for Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) support, using data from a reconnaissance script. SSP, introduced in Bluetooth 2.1, enhances security through pairing methods like Numeric Comparison and Passkey Entry, reducing risks of eavesdropping and MITM attacks. When SSP is not supported, the device defaults to weaker legacy pairing, which relies on fixed PINs and is vulnerable to interception. This lack of SSP is a security flaw, as attackers within range could exploit outdated pairing to access or manipulate the device."
