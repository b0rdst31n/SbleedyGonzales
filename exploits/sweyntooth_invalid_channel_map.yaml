description: "The Invalid Channel Map Crash/Deadlock vulnerability affects Microchip ATSAMB11 BluSDK Smart v6.2, ESP32 esp-idf v4.2, and nRF51/52 Zephyr Bluetooth Stack v2.2.0. By sending a connection request with a cleared channel map, an attacker can disrupt device functionality. This leads to a failure to re-enable advertisements on the ATSAMB11, and immediate restarts on ESP32 and nRF51/52 devices, resulting in denial of service. Shared Bluetooth IP designs suggest this vulnerability may impact additional SoCs."
