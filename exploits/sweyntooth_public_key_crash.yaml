description: "A vulnerability in Texas Instruments CC2640R2 BLE-STACK-SDK (v3.30.00.20 and earlier) affects the Secure Manager Protocol (SMP) during legacy pairing. By sending an SMP public key packet before pairing starts, an attacker within radio range can trigger a hard fault, as the peripheral incorrectly accepts and tries to copy the key to a null address. This results in a denial of service (DoS) and potentially causes device deadlock, as seen in products like the CubiTag tracker, requiring manual device restart. This vulnerability, however, does not enable buffer overflow or memory control by the attacker."
