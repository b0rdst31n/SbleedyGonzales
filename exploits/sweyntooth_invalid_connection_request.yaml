description: "In Texas Instruments CC2640R2 (BLE-STACK SDK v3.30.00.20 and prior) and CC2540 SDK (v1.5.0 and prior), a vulnerability allows attackers within radio range to send invalid connection requests with zero values for interval or timeout parameters, causing the peripheral to enter an idle state and stop advertising. If the productâ€™s code does not handle this idle state, the device remains unresponsive, requiring a manual restart. Additionally, truncated connection requests can trigger the same issue in CC2540 devices. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service (DoS) and potential device deadlock, impacting products without state handling mechanisms."
