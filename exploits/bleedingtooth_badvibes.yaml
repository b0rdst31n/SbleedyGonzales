description: "The BleedingTooth Bluetooth vulnerability, known as BadVibes, is a critical security flaw in the Bluetooth protocol stack on Linux-based systems. Discovered in 2020, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker within Bluetooth range to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service without user interaction, due to improper validation in the Bluetooth stack. By exploiting *BadVibes*, an attacker can send specially crafted signals that trigger the vulnerability, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or causing system crashes. Patches were released shortly after its discovery to mitigate this security risk, highlighting the importance of regularly updating device firmware to protect against similar Bluetooth vulnerabilities."
