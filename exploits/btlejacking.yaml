description: "BTLEJacking is an attack on BLE devices that allows an attacker to sniff, jam, and take over connections by exploiting the Supervision Timeout feature. Using the btlejack tool, an attacker can disrupt the keepalive packets, triggering the timeout while maintaining a hidden connection. The attack can bypass authentication, hijack connections, and cause information leakage."
