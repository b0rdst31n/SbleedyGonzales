description: "The Key Size Overflow vulnerability in Telink Semiconductor BLE SDKs enables a buffer overflow during the pairing procedure by accepting an excessive encryption key size of up to 255 bytes rather than the standard 7â€“16 bytes. Coupled with the premature initiation of the LL Encryption procedure, this flaw allows attackers within radio range to destabilize devices with pairing support, causing crashes and risking adjacent memory overwrites. In severe cases, attackers could manipulate buffers holding encryption nonces, potentially bypassing encryption and exposing sensitive user data."
