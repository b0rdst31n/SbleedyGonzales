description: "A vulnerability in version 2.2.0 of the Zephyr RTOS Bluetooth stack allows an attacker within radio range to trigger memory corruption on devices using this stack by initiating a BLE connection with an invalid Anchor Point packet. By setting the NESN and SN bits to 1, the attacker forces the Zephyr peripheral to perform an invalid operation on its packet buffer, ultimately filling the retry-buffer and causing memory corruption. This results in a denial of service, either crashing the peripheral or leaving it unstable, particularly when a legitimate central device later attempts to connect. The attack is easy to execute as it requires no authentication."
