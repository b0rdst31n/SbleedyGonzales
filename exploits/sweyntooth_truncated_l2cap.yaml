description: "The Truncated L2CAP vulnerability in Dialog DA14580 devices (SDK 5.0.4 or earlier) allows attackers within radio range to overflow the L2CAP reception buffer by manipulating packet lengths. By sending an LL Length shorter than expected, attackers can crash the device or, with carefully crafted packets, overwrite memory adjacent to the buffer, potentially enabling remote code execution. This vulnerability primarily risks denial of service but could also allow deeper system compromise."
