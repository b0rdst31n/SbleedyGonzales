description: "This BlueBorne vulnerability is a critical Bluetooth flaw that allows attackers to remotely execute code on devices without pairing or user interaction. By exploiting weaknesses in the Bluetooth stack, attackers within range can gain control over targeted devices, spread malware, or access sensitive data. This vulnerability affects a wide range of devices, including Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux, and poses significant security risks due to the ubiquity of Bluetooth in modern devices. BlueBorne highlights the importance of keeping Bluetooth implementations secure to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches."
