description: "Check if the BLE peripheral accepts its key size to be reduced to 7 bytes. This is application dependent as some devices may be programmed to allow the key to be within the standardized BLE key size (7-16). More secure applications strictly rejects any key size lower than 16. (Unpatched Telink SDKs allowed key sizes higher than 16, which is non-compliant)."
