description: "The Dialog DA14680 devices are vulnerable to a Link Layer Length Overflow attack, where the peripheral may crash if it receives packets with unexpectedly high LL Length values, particularly for packet types like pairing requests. Though initially compliant behavior appears unaffected, a buffer overflow is triggered under certain conditions, leading to denial of service. Due to the overflow risk, this vulnerability could potentially allow remote code execution, particularly concerning given the widespread use of these SoCs in smart home products."
