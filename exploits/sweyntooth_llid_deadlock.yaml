description: "The Cypress (CVE-2019-17061) and NXP KW41Z (CVE-2019-17060) devices are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that causes a deadlock state upon receiving a packet with a cleared LLID field. This bug disrupts BLE functionality, leaving the device unresponsive to new connections or commands without triggering an error, thus requiring a manual power cycle to restore communication. The device continues to advertise, masking the issue until the user attempts a connection, which results in an endless pairing loop."
