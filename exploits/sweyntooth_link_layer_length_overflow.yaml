description: "The Link Layer Length Overflow vulnerability in Cypress PSoC4/6 BLE (CVE-2019-16336) and NXP KW41Z SDK (CVE-2019-17519) allows attackers within radio range to cause a buffer overflow by manipulating the LL Length Field. By sending an oversized packet, attackers can overload the memory allocation, leading to denial of service (DoS) and potential remote code execution, similar to the BleedingBit vulnerability in Texas Instruments devices."
